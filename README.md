# openPowerLink-Ada

This is becoming a thin Ada binding for open PowerLink version 2.1.
All the work files are still present. The semi finished product is in ./oplk_ada together with the HTML doku.

I have not sorted the licensing issue yet. For the time being consider it to be licensed under GPL.

Enjoy!
